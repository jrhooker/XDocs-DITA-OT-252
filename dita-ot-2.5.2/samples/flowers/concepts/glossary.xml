    <title>pollination</title>

    <conbody>
      <p><b>Pollination</b> is
      the process by which pollen is transferred in plants, thereby enabling
      fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Pollination is a necessary step
      in the reproduction of flowering plants, resulting in the production of
      offspring that are genetically diverse.</p>

  <concept id="sepal" xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/">
    <title>sepal</title>

    <conbody>
      <p>A <b>sepal</b> (from
      Latin <i>separatus</i> "separate" + <i>petalum</i> "petal") is a part of the flower
      of flowering plants. <b>Sepals</b> in a
      "typical" flower are green and lie under the more conspicuous petals. As
      a collective unit the sepals are called the calyx, and the collection of
      petals is called the corolla. Together, these two structures are known
      as the perianth of the flower. The petals and sepals are usually
      differentiated into colorful petals and green sepals. The term tepal is
      usually applied when the petals and sepals are not differentiated and
      look similar or the petals are absent and the sepals are colorful. When
      the flower is in bud, the sepals enclose and protect the more delicate
      floral parts within. Morphologically they are modified leaves.</p>

  <concept id="rhizome" xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/">
    <title>rhizome</title>

    <conbody>
      <p>A <b>rhizome</b> is a
      characteristically horizontal stem of a plant that is usually found
      underground, often sending out roots and shoots from its nodes. Some
      plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil
      surface, including some Iris species, and ferns, whose spreading stems
      are rhizomes. Rhizomes may also be referred to as creeping rootstalks,
      or rootstocks.</p>

  <concept id="bulb" xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/">
    <title>bulb</title>

    <conbody>
      <p>A <b>bulb</b> is an
      underground vertical shoot that has modified leaves (or thickened leaf
      bases) that are used as food storage organs by a dormant plant.</p>

  <concept id="cultivar" xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/">
    <title>cultivar</title>

    <conbody>
      <p>A <b>cultivar</b> is a
      cultivated plant that has been selected and given a unique name because
      of its decorative or useful characteristics; it is usually distinct from
      similar plants and when propagated it retains those characteristics. The
      word cultivar is generally regarded as a portmanteau of "<b>culti</b>vated" and "<b>var</b>iety", but could also be derived from
      "<b>culti</b>gen" "<b>var</b>iety".</p>

  <concept id="perennial" xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/">
    <title>perennial</title>

    <conbody>
      <p>A <b>perennial</b>
      plant or perennial is a plant that lives for more than two years. When
      used by gardeners or horticulturists, this term applies specifically to
      perennial herbaceous plants. Scientifically, woody plants like shrubs
      and trees are also perennial in their habit.</p>

  <concept id="panicle" xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/">
    <title>panicle</title>

    <conbody>
      <p>A <b>panicle</b> is a
      compound raceme, a loose, much-branched indeterminate inflorescence with
      pedicellate flowers (and fruit) attached along the secondary branches
      (in other words, a branched cluster of flowers in which the branches are
      racemes).</p>
