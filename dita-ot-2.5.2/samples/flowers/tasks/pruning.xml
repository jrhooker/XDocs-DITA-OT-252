    <title>Pruning</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p><b>Pruning</b> is the process of removing certain above-ground elements from a plant;
                in landscaping this process usually involves removal of diseased, non-productive, or
                otherwise unwanted portions from a plant. In nature, certain meteorological
                conditions such as wind, snow or seawater mist can conduct a natural pruning
                process. The purpose of anthropomorphic pruning is to shape the plant by controlling
                or directing plant growth, to maintain the health of the plant, or to increase the
                yield or quality of flowers and fruits.</p>
            <p>In general the smaller the wound (smaller the branch that is cut) the less harm to
                the tree. It is therefore typically better to formative prune the tree when juvenile
                than try to cut off large branches on a mature tree.</p>
            <p>Follow these simple steps:</p>

        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Begin by cutting out all the dead branches.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Remove all tangled or crossed over branches. This allows air to circulate and
                    reduces bug and fungi infestation. </cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Take your time! Work comfortably and do not make shortcuts when cutting stems.
                    Use good quality, sharp tools.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Clean up the area. Burn all pest infested branches. </cmd>
            </step>
