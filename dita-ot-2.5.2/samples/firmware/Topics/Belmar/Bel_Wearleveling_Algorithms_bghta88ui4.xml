   <title>Wearleveling Algorithms</title>
   <body>
      

      <p>There are two type of data exists in NAND flash devices: static
      and dynamic. Static data is rarely updated, whereas dynamic data is
      constantly changing and requires frequent reprogramming. Dynamic data
      makes a particular block to be programmed and erased repeatedly without
      writing to any other blocks. That block would wear out before all the
      other blocks. The wearleveling algorithm distributes the writes as
      evenly as possible across all the flash blocks.</p>

      <p>Wearleveling can be implemented using several methods, each of
      which adds complexity but increases the life of NAND flash devices. Lack
      of wearleveling can dramatically reduce the useful life of the NAND
      flash device. There are two kinds of wearleveling that can be
      implemented in the FTL.</p>

            <p>Dynamic Wearleveling</p>

            <p>When applying the dynamic wearleveling, new data is programmed
          to the free blocks that have the lowest erase count.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="d1e2666">
            <p>Static Wearleveling</p>

            <p>With static wearleveling, the context of blocks storing static
          data is copied to a block that has a high erase count, so that the
          original block can be used for data that is changed more
          frequently</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The firmware implements a priority based algorithm for both static
      and dynamic wearleveling.</p>
