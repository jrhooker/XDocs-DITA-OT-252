  <body>
    <p>The recovery manager tries to recover the
    uncorrectable read error by reading the ECC chuck with uncorrectable error
    a specific number of times. Every read retry will cover one ECC chunk.
    After read retry, if there is still uncorrectable error, we will send data
    in the raw buffer to LDPC engine for soft decoding. </p>

    <p>The flash address come from the Lookup manager when
    read errors are caused by host read, or Wearlevelling manager when read
    errors are caused by Garbage Collection data reclaim.</p>

    <p>The Recovery Manager performs read retry and sends
    the result back to the Lookup manager or the Wearlevelling manager.</p>
