      <p>The Lookup Manager is responsible for managing the Logical to
      Physical mapping table entries (lookup table, L2P Table). It performs
      read, read and lock, and update operations on the Lookup Table. The
      logical address received with read/write/dataFrameWrite requests is used
      as the index to the L2P table. The Lookup Manager is also responsible
      for distributing the user data across all channels, targets, and LUNs.
      It is also responsible for handling read/write errors from the flash
      interface.</p>

      <p>When WriteReq is received, the Lookup Manager reads and locks the
      lookup table entry for a given logical address and assigns a flash
      address for the current data frame. When enough data frames are
      available to write one page frame, the Lookup Manager sends a
      pageFrameWrite message to the Write Manager. When a flash completion is
      received for page frame write, the Lookup Manager updates lookup table
      entries for all data frames, releases the data frame buffer, and sends
      write completions. If the old lookup table entry is valid, an
      obsoleteDataFrame request will be sent to the Wearleveling
      Managers.</p>

      <p>When ReadReq is received, the Lookup Manager reads the lookup
      table entry for a given logical address. If the lookup table entry is
      not locked, a flash read request is sent to the flash interface to read
      data frame data. Read completions are sent to the requester upon
      receiving flash completions. If the lookup table entry is not valid,
      read completion status is updated with a virgin bit.</p>

      <p>When DataFrameWriteReq is received, the Lookup Manager assigns a
      flash address for the current data frame. When enough data frames are
      available to write one page frame, the Lookup Manager sends a
      pageFrameWrite message to the Write Manager. When a flash completion is
      received for a page frame write, the Lookup Manager updates lookup table
      entries for all data frames and releases the data frame buffer.</p>

      <p>In addition to the read//write requests, the Lookup Manager
      processes Admin Command Manager requests, such as flush, namespace
      management, dataset management, smart update etc, from the Admin Command
      Manager.</p>

      <p>To achieve maximum performance, two Lookup Managers (LOOKUP_MGR0
      and LOOKUP_MGR1) are instantiated. Each Lookup Manager operates in an
      non-blocking, asynchronous event-driven manner in order to hide the
      latency associated with the flash accesses.</p>
