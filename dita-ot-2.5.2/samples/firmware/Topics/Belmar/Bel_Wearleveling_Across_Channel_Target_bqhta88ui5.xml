   <title>Wearleveling Across Channel/Target</title>
   <body>
        

        <p>Since the write request is distributed evenly across all
        channels and targets, data should be written evenly to all virtual
        targets. Depending upon the traffic pattern, virtual blocks across
        different targets may not be erased evenly. The priority based
        wearleveling works within a virtual target only. In order to perform
        wearleveling across virtual targets, the average erase count of all
        virtual targets is maintained. When the average erase count of a
        virtual target is higher than a high water mark threshold, the virtual
        target is skipped for every other write request. When the average
        erase count falls below a low water mark threshold, the virtual target
        can be written on every write request.</p>
