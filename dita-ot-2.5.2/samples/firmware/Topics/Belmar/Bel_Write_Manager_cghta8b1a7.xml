    <p>All flash writes are initiated by the Write Manager.
    The Write Manager receives page frame write requests from the Lookup
    Managers[0:1], updates the controller metadata, and issues flash write
    requests to the flash interface</p>

    <p>The controller metadata is used by the Wearleveling
    Manager to reconstruct the FTL data structures, such as L2P table, block
    information, etc, in the event of an improper shutdown.</p>

    <p>In case of multi-plane write, the Write Manager
    creates a chained message for a flash write request. If there is not
    enough data (to write even number of planes) from the Lookup Manager to
    perform multi-plane operation, the Write Manager inserts dummy data to
    complete the multi-plane operation.</p>

    <p>Since the Write Manager is aware of how many flash
    writes are issued to the flash, It sends a message to the Journal Manager
    to initiate a snapshot write.</p>
