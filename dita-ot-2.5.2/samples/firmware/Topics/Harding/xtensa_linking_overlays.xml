  <title>Linking Overlays</title>

  <body>
    <p>Overlay linking done for the Xtensa manager is similar to how it is
    done for the PMC manager, with the following differences:<ul>
        <li><p> No more overlay table or overlay data created in DDR</p></li>
      </ul></p>

    <p><ul>
        <li><p>No more rodata section in D-RAM for overlays</p></li>
      </ul></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Old tables for PMC manager are no longer used, now only the table
      _ovly_table is used along with a overlay stubs table which creates
      function stubs needed by the overlay manager</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Another important change to this process is that updateLinkerScripts.pl
    now updates two new files: declOvl.h and systemConfig.h. The file
    declOvl.h is updated with the Xtensa overlay declaration macros as well as
    the macros necessary for defining overlays. systemConfig.h is updated with
    a macro that will enable the PMC overlay manager when it is defined, and
    enable the Xtensa manager when it is undefined. Refer to <xref href="../Linker_Script_svht7esfi1.xml"/>
    for greater details on linking overlays.</p>
