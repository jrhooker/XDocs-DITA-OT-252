  <title>Memory Map for Overlays</title>

  <body>
    <p>For the Xtensa overlay manager, the memory map looks very similar to
    the PMC manager shown here: <xref href="../Memory_Map_for_Overlays_tght7esfi4.xml#Memory_Map_for_Overlays_tght7esfi4/DDR_Map_for_Multiprocessor_tjht7esfi4"/></p>

    <p>Xtensa is just simplified to no longer include overlay data or table
    sections. This means that there is no longer any loading something to the
    D-RAM but loading code sections to the I-RAM is the same. The only overlay
    table now necessary is put into the D-RAM at runtime and gets its fields
    updated by the overlay manager as overlays are mapped.</p>
