  <title>Linker Script Table</title>

  <body>
    <p>This table is placed into linker scripts by running
    updateLinkerScripts.pl and is placed once into the DRAM at runtime. This
    table tracks which overlays are mapped and is used by the Xtensa overlay
    manager when loading overlays. This same table is used by GDB to enable
    debugging. The table must be named _ovly_table and it is an array composed
    of the following structure:</p>

    <codeblock>struct
{
/*The overlay's mapped address. */
unsigned long vma;

/* The size of the overlay, in bytes. */
unsigned long size;

/* The overlay's load address. */
unsigned long lma;

/* Non-zero if the overlay is mapped, zero otherwise. */
unsigned long mapped;
}</codeblock>
