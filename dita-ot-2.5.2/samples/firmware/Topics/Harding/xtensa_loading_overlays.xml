  <title>Loading Overlays</title>

  <body>
    <p>The Xtensa overlay manager shares its loading mechanism with the PMC
    overlay manager. By default Xtensa overlay manager provides a loading
    function using memcpy from the gcc library to perform loading. This
    function was given a weak definition so that users can provide their own
    loading function. Refer to <xref href="../Loading_Overlay_toht7esfi5.xml"/> for details on
    the loading mechanism.</p>
