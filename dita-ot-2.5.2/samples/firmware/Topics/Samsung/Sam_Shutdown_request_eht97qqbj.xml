  <title>Shutdown request</title>

  <body>
    <p>The PCIe may initiate a shutdown request to the
    system. The Admin Command Manager will take this request and issue a flush
    command. If this is a normal shutdown request, it will also save off all
    partition metadata and issue a completion. An abrupt shutdown will not
    save off the partition metadata, and no completion is required. For more
    information on the PCIe initiated shutdown flows, refer to <xref href="../Shutdown_yhsg9zajw.xml"/>.</p>
