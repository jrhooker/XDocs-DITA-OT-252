    <p>NVM Express read requests are received from the Submission Queue
    Manager by the Data Managers. The Data Managers break these requests in to
    Data Frame read requests and issue them to the Mapping Managers. The
    Mapping Managers issue the flash read operations and reply back to the
    Data Managers when the read operations are complete. The Data Managers
    then DMA the data to the host system's memory and issue a completion to
    the host via the Completion Queue Manager. See <xref href="Sam_Control_Flows_5bht98nxzf.xml#Control_Flows_5bht98nxzf/Read_5iht98nxzf"/>
    for the complete details of this flow.</p>
