   <title>Mapping Manager Read/Write Requests</title>
   <body>
      

      <p>Data Managers issue Data Frame read/write requests
      (ReadReq/WriteReq) to the Mapping Managers in a round-robin fashion. It
      is desirable for the Data Managers to skip a Mapping Manager if its
      inbound IPC port is full. Each Data Manager is initialized to start with
      a different Mapping Manager; that is, Data Manager 0 uses Mapping
      Manager 0 and Data Manager 1 uses Mapping Manager 1, etc.</p>
