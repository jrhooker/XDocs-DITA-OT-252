  <title>Flush</title>

  <body>
    <p>The flush command indicates that all volatile
    information is to be saved off to non-volatile memory. When the flush
    command is received, the Admin Command Manager will attempt to lock the
    entire LBA range. When it obtains this lock, it issues the flush request
    to the Mapping Managers. After completion of this request, it will release
    the lock. See <xref href="../Flush_9kht7esffp.xml"> </xref> for details of
    this flow.</p>
