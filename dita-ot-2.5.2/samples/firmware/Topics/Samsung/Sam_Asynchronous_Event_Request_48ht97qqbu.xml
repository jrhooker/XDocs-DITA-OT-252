  <title>Asynchronous Event Request</title>

  <body>
    <p>Asynchronous events are used to notify host software
    of error and health information as these events occur. To enable
    asynchronous events to be reported by the controller, host software needs
    to issue one or more Asynchronous Event Request commands to the
    controller. The controller indicates an event to the host by completing an
    Asynchronous Event Request command. Host software should expect that the
    controller may not execute the command immediately; the command is
    completed when there is an event to be posted.</p>

    <p>Asynchronous Event Requests are queued in by the
    Admin Command Manager until an event causes an <xref href="Sam_Asynchronous_Event_Completion_4bht97qqbu.xml">Asynchronous
    Event Completion</xref> to be sent to the host.</p>
