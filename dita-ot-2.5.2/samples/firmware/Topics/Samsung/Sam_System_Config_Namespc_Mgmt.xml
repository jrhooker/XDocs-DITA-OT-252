  <title>Namespace Management</title>

  <body>
    <p>Two Namespace Management commands are defined for
    user applications to manage the associated namespaces. Each namespace
    contains a certain amount of namespace units that need to be contiguous. A
    namespace unit is the smallest addressable unit for Namespace Management
    commands. There might be some namespace units located between namespaces
    that do not belong to any namespaces.</p>

    <p>In the sense of system programming, the size of each
    namespace unit should be a multiple of the flash physical page size that
    is also a multiple of the supported LBA data sizes by the controller. Due
    to the foreseeable increase in flash page size, it is appropriate to
    decide the namespace unit size as 32KB, for example.</p>
