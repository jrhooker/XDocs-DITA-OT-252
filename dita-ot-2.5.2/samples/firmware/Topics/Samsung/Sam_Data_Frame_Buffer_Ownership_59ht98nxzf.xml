  <title>Data Frame Buffer Ownership</title>

  <body>
    <p>During NVM Express read operations, the Data Manager
    will request the allocation of a Data Frame buffer from the Buffer Manager
    and free the Data Frame buffer when it is no longer needed. During NVM
    Express write operations, the Data Manager will allocate the Data Frame
    buffers, but ownership of the buffers will pass to the FTL when the
    WriteReq is issued. It is then the responsibility of the FTL to free the
    Data Frame buffer when it is no longer required.</p>
