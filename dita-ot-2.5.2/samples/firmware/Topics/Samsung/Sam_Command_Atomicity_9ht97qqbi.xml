      <p>The Admin Command Manager ensures that only one admin command is
      processed at a time by masking the inbound IPC ports used to receive
      admin commands from other managers once an admin command has been
      received. The Admin Command Manager is still able to receive completions
      to admin requests it issues to other managers via a second inbound IPC
      port used solely for admin request completions. When a received admin
      command has been successfully processed, the inbound IPC ports are
      unmasked, allowing the reception of a new admin command.</p>
