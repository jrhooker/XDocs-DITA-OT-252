  <title>Write</title>

  <body>
    <p>NVM Express write requests are received from the
    Submission Queue Manager by the Data Managers. The Data Managers break
    these requests in to Data Frame writes and DMA the data to be written from
    the host system's memory to controller memory. Requests are then issued to
    the Mapping Managers to write the data to flash. The Mapping Managers
    issue the flash write operations and reply back to the Data Managers when
    the write operations are complete. The Data Managers then issue
    completions to the host via the Completion Queue Manager. See <xref href="Sam_Control_Flows_5bht98nxzf.xml#Control_Flows_5bht98nxzf/Write_5fht98nxzf"/>
    for the complete details of this flow.</p>
